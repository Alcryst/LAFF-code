# Programming exercises for the Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers "book"

This repository contains Python code written for programming exercises in the course notes for UT Austin's free online course ["Linear Algebra: Foundations to Frontiers"](http://www.ulaff.net/). I am writing this code for purposes of honing my own programming skills and so do not guarantee any of this code is correct or useful; in fact, everything in this repository is probably implemented online with more widely accepted and/or efficient solutions. Granted, if you are a fellow learner or just someone looking to examine my thought process, this repository will be (more) useful for that purpose.

With that disclaimer out of the way, have fun using this code (within the terms of the license, of course). I will aim to use no libraries beside those that come with the standard installation of Python 3.

Note that the original LAFF exercises are intended to be implemented in MATLAB. However, I am not fluent enough with MATLAB to avoid transforming the exercises into MATLAB training rather than linear algebra training, and as I anticipate to learn MATLAB in a few months in my coursework, I have no particular desire to get a headstart on that particular process. I may revisit this repository to rewrite the code in MATLAB or some other language (Rust?), but there are no guarantees on if or when I do so.
